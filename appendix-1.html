<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.2.2</span> Research Protocol</h3>
<p>In this appendix, we will describe in detail how we applied the protocol for performing systematic literature reviews by Kitchenham <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kitchenham2004procedures">104</a>]</span>. In order, we will go over the search strategy, study selection, study quality assessment, and data extraction. The last subsection will list which studies we included in this review and which we have found, but excluded from the review for a specific reason.</p>
<div id="search-strategy-2" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">11.2.2.1</span> Search Strategy</h4>
<p>Since release engineering is a relatively new research topic, we took an exploratory approach in collecting any literature revolving around the topic of release engineering from the perspective of software analytics. This aided us to determine a more narrow scope for our survey, subsequently to allow us to find additional literature to fit this scope.</p>
<p>At the start of this project, we were provided with an initial seed of five papers as a starting point for our literature survey <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-adams2016a">4</a>, <a href="#ref-da2014a">48</a>, <a href="#ref-da2016a">49</a>, <a href="#ref-khomh2015a">97</a>, <a href="#ref-khomh2012a">98</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>We collected other publications using two search engines: Scopus and Google Scholar. Each of the two search engines comprises several databases such as ACM Digital Library, Springer, IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect. The main query that we constructed is displayed in Figure 1. The publications found using this query were:</p>

<p>In addition to querying search engines as described above, references related to retrieved papers were analyzed. These reference lists were obtained from Google Scholar and from the <em>References</em> section in the papers themselves. We selected all papers on release engineering that are citing or being cited by the initial set of papers. Using this approach, we have found six additional papers.

<p>All the papers that were found, were stored in a custom-built web-based tool for conducting literature reviews. The source code of this tool is published in a GitHub repository.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The tool was hosted on a virtual private server, such that all retrieved publications were stored centrally, accessible to all reviewers.</p>
</div>
<div id="study-selection" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">11.2.2.2</span> Study Selection</h4>
<p>We selected the studies that we wanted to include in the survey with aid of the aforementioned tool for storing the papers. In this tool, it is possible to label papers with tags and leave comments and ratings. Every paper is reviewed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on this, the tool allowed to filter out all papers that appeared not to be relevant for this literature survey.</p>
<p>We only used one exclusion criteria: studies that are published before 2014, will not be included in our survey (this is enforced by our search query). The inclusion criteria are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The study must show (at least) one release engineering technique.</li>
<li>The study must not just show a release engineering technique, but analyze its performance compared to other techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last subsection of this appendix lists which studies were selected and which were discareded.</p>

<div id="study-quality-assessment" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">11.2.2.3</span> Study Quality Assessment</h4>
<p>Based on Kitchenham <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kitchenham2004procedures">104</a>]</span>, the quality of a paper will be assessed by the evidence it provides, based on the following scale. All levels of quality in this scale will be accepted, except for level 5 (evidence obtained from expert opinion).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evidence obtained from at least one properly-designed randomised controlled trial.</li>
<li>Evidence obtained from well-designed pseudo-randomised controlled trials (i.e. non-random allocation to treatment).</li>
<li>Comparative studies in a real-world setting:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evidence obtained from comparative studies with concurrent controls and allocation not randomised, cohort studies, case-control studies or interrupted time series with a control group.</li>
<li>Evidence obtained from comparative studies with historical control, two or more single arm studies, or interrupted time series without a parallel control group.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Experiments in artificial settings:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evidence obtained from a randomised experiment performed in an artificial setting.</li>
<li>Evidence obtained from case series, either post-test or pre-test/post-test.</li>
<li>Evidence obtained from a quasi-random experiment performed in an artificial setting.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Evidence obtained from expert opinion based on theory or consensus.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, the studies will be examined to see if they contain any type of bias. For this, the same types of biases will be used as described by <a href="mailto:Kitchenham@kitchenham2004procedures">Kitchenham@kitchenham2004procedures</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selection/Allocation bias: Systematic difference between comparison groups with respect to treatment.</li>
<li>Performance bias: Systematic difference is the conduct of comparison groups apart from the treatment being evaluated.</li>
<li>Measurement/Detection bias: Systematic difference between the groups in how outcomes are ascertained.</li>
<li>Attrition/Exclusion bias: Systematic differences between comparison groups in terms of withdrawals or exclusions of participants from the study sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>The studies will be labeled by their quality level and possible biases. This information can be used during the Data Synthesis phase to weigh the importance of individual studies <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kitchenham2004procedures">104</a>]</span>.</p>

<div id="data-extraction" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">11.2.2.4</span> Data Extraction</h4>
<p>To accurately capture the information contributed by each publication in our survey, we will use a systematic approach to extracting data. To guide this process, we will be using a data extraction form which describes what aspects of a publication are crucial to record. Besides general publication information (title, author etc.), the form contains questions that are based on our defined research questions. Furthermore, the form contains a section for quantitative research, where aspects such as population and evaluation will be documented. The form that is used for this is shown below:</p>
<pre><code>General information:

- Name of person extracting data:
- Date form completed (dd/mm/yyyy):

<h4><span class="header-section-number">11.2.2.5</span> Data Synthesis</h4>
<p>To summarize the contributions and limitations of each of the included publications, we will apply a descriptive synthesis approach. In this part of our survey, we will compare the data that was extracted of the included publications. Publications with similar findings will be grouped and evaluated, and differences between groups of publications will be structured and elaborated on. In this we will compare them using specifics such as their study types, time of publication and study quality.</p>
<p>If the extracted data allows for a structured tabular visualization of similarities and differences between publications this we serve as an additional form of synthesis. However, this depends on the final included publications of this survey.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since there are two case studies, the results become a bit more generalizable</li>
<li>The author set up a theory that encapsulates the communication and coordination regarding release management in FOSS ecosystems, and can be summarized as:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The size and complexity of the integrated product is constrained by the release managers capacity</li>
<li>The release management should reach the whole ecosystem to increase awareness and participation</li>
<li>The release managers need social and technical skills</li>

<p>What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims that modern release engineering practices allow for software to be delivered faster and cheaper should be further empirically validated.</li>
<li>This analysis could be extended with industry case studies, to develop a checklist for analyzing company and ecosystem readiness for continuous delivery and continuous deployment.</li>
<li>The comprehensive reporting of the context and how the practice is implemented instead of merely referring to usage of the practice should be considered by future research.</li>
<li>Different stakeholders’ points of view, such as customer perceptions regarding practices require further research.</li>
<li>Research on DevOps would be highly relevant for release engineering and the continuous software engineering research domain.</li>

<li>Method(s) of recruitment of participants:</li>
<li>Sample size: 43198 bug fixes, no further sample sizes of the raw data mentioned anywhere unfortunately. (Data from Mozilla Firefox project.)</li>
<li>Evaluation/measurement description: Associate commit log, bug reports and releases. Classify backouts. Measure rate of backouts against all fixed bugs, per month and per release strategy period. Test for statistical significance using Fisher’s exact test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</li>
<li>Outcomes:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Absolute numbers of bug fixes and backouts increased under rapid releases (probably the increase in regular contributors played a role, cannot conclude anything about workload.)</li>
<li>Backout rate increased under rapid releases (sheriff managed integration repositories may have increased the prevalence of backout culture)</li>
<li>Higher early backout rate and lower late backout rate indicate a shift towards earlier problem detection (proportion early from 57 to 88 %) The time-to-backout also dropped.</li>

<li>larger code base and more products -&gt; more conflicts</li>
<li>evolution of automated testing toolset -&gt; earlier and more backouts</li>
<li>sheriff managed integration repos -&gt; earlier and more backouts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explanations of impact
<ul>
<li>cultural shift reduced testing efforts beforehand, and higher early backout rate eventually reduced the effort to integrate bug fixes for developers</li>
<li>given the many stabilization channels and the rarity of very late backouts both in traditional and rapid release cycles, changes in backouts do not seem to influence users’ perception of quality (even though frequent update notifications and broken compatibilities caused upset users)</li>

</ul>
<p>What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>Branching and merging
<ul>
<li>Software teams rely on Version Control Systems</li>
<li>Quality assurance activities like code reviews are used before doing a merge or even allowing a code change to be committed into a branch</li>
<li>Keep branches short-lived and merge often. If this is impossible, a rebase can be done.</li>
<li>“trunk-based development” can be applied to eliminate most branches below the master branch.</li>
<li>Feature toggles are used to provide isolation for new features in case of the absence of branches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Building and testing
<ul>
<li>To help assess build and test conflicts, many projects also provide “try” servers to development teams, which automatically runs a build and test process referred to as CI.</li>
<li>The CI process often does not run full test, but a representative subset.</li>
<li>The more intensive tests, such as integration, system or performance typically get run nightly or in weekends.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Build system:
<ul>
<li>GNU Make is the most popular file-based build system technology. Ant is the prototypical task-based build system technology. Lifecycle-based build technologies like Maven consider the build system of a project to have a sequence of standard build activities that together form a “build lifecycle.”</li>
<li>“Reproducible builds” involve for a given feature and hardware configuration of the code base, every build invoca- tion should yield bit-to-bit identical build results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Infrastructure-as-code
<ul>
<li>Containers or virtual machines are used to deploy new versions of the system for testing or even production.</li>
<li>It has been recommended that infrastructure code is to be stored in a separate VCS repository than source code, in order to restrict access to infrastructure code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deployment
<ul>
<li>The term “dark launching” corresponds to deploying new features without releasing them to the public, in which parts of the system automatically make calls to the hidden features in a way invisible to end users.</li>
<li>“Blue green deployment” deploys the next software version on a copy of the production environment, and changes this to be the main enviroment on release.</li>
<li>In “canary deployment” a prospective release of the software system is loaded onto a subset of the production environments for only a subset of users.</li>
<li>“A/B testing” deploys alternative A of a feature to the environment of a subset of the user base, while alternative B is deployed to the environment of another subset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Release
<ul>
<li>Once a deployed version of a system is released, the release engineers monitor telemetry data and crash logs to track the performance and quality of releases. Several frameworks and applications have been introduced for this.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of the practice? Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of these practices are classified by the paper as state of the practice, but state of the art practices are also mentioned.</li>
</ul>
<p>What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>Branching and merging
<ul>
<li>No methodology or insight exists on how to empirically validate the best branching structure for a given organization or project, and what results in the smallest amount of merge conflicts.</li>
<li>Release engineers need to pay particular attention to conflicts and incompatibilities caused by evolving library and API dependencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Building and testing
<ul>
<li>Speeding up CI might be the major concern of practitioners. This speed up can be achieved through predicting whether a code change will break the build, or by “chunking” code changes into a group and only compile and test each group once.</li>
<li>The concept of “green builds” slowly is becoming an issue, in the sense that frequent triggering of the CI server consumes energy.</li>
<li>Security of the release engineering pipeline in general, and the CI server in particular, also has become a major concern.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Release
<ul>
<li>Qualitative studies are not only essential to understand the rationale behind quantitative findings, but also to identify design patterns and best practices for build systems.
<ul>
<li>How can developers make their builds more maintainable and of higher quality?</li>
<li>What refactorings should be performed for which build system anti-patterns?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identification and resolution of build bugs, i.e., source code or build specification changes that cause build breakage, possibly on a subset of the supported platforms.</li>
<li>Basic tools have a hard time determining what part of the system is necessary to build.</li>
<li>Studies on non-GNU Make build systems are missing.</li>
<li>Apart from identifying bottlenecks, such approaches should also suggest concrete refactorings of the build system specifications or source code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Infrastructure-as-code
<ul>
<li>Research on differences between infrastructure languages is lacking.</li>
<li>Best practices and design patterns for infrastructure-as-code need to be documented.</li>
<li>Qualitative analysis of infrastructure code will be necessary to understand how developers address different infrastructure needs.</li>
<li>Quantitative analysis of the version control and bug report systems can then help to determine which patterns were beneficial in terms of maintenance effort and/or quality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deployment
<ul>
<li>More emperical studies can be done to answer question like this:
<ul>
<li>Is blue-green deployment the fastest means to deploy a new version of a web app?</li>
<li>Are A/B testing and dark launching worth the investment and risk?</li>
<li>Should one use containers or virtual machines for a medium-sized web app in order to meet application performance and robustness criteria?</li>
<li>If an app is part of a suite of apps built around a common database, should each app be deployed in a different container?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better tools for quality assurance are required, to prevent showstopper bugs from slipping through and requiring re-deployment of a mobile app version (with corresponding vetting), these include:
<ul>
<li>Defect prediction (either file- or commit-based)</li>
<li>Smarter/safer update mechanisms</li>
<li>Tools for improving code review</li>
<li>Generating tests</li>
<li>Filtering and interpreting crash reports</li>
<li>Prioritization and triaging of defect reports</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Release
<ul>
<li>More research is needed on determining which code change is the perfect one for triggering the release of one of these releases, or whether a canary is good enough to be released to another data centre.</li>
<li>Question such as the following should be investigated:
<ul>
<li>Should one release on all platforms at the same time?</li>
<li>In the case of defects, which platform should receive priority?</li>
<li>Should all platforms use the same version numbering, or should that be feature-dependent?</li>
<li>Research on the continuous delivery and rapid releases from other systems should be explored.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>What research gaps does this publication contain?</p>
<ul>
<li>As is common with surveys, it does not contain the state of the field today. More quantitive and qualitive research has been done, which can not possibly be included.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are these research gaps filled by any other publications in this survey?</p>
<ul>

<li>Journal: 13th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories (2016)</li>
<li>Publication type: Conference paper</li>
<li>Type of study: Emperical study</li>
</ul>
<p>What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>To give a context to the study, the paper describes the concept of traditional releases, rapid releases, their differences, and how issue reports are structured.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of the practice? Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>State of the practice. The paper describes common practices that were in use at the time of the publication.</li>
</ul>
<p>What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>The study mentions that comparing systems with different release structures is difficult since one has to distinguish to what extent the results are due to the release strategy and which are due to intricacies of the systems or organization itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>What research gaps does this publication contain?</p>
<ul>
<li>The main gap in this study is the specificity of the data. Only Mozilla has been considered, and external factors such as other organizational challenges which could have an effect on release time could not be included. More research that looks further into comparing this case to that of other organizations is needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are these research gaps filled by any other publications in this survey?</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Quantitative research publications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study start date: Used data starts from 1999</li>
<li>Study end date or duration: Used data ends in 2010</li>
<li>Population description: The paper describes multiple steps to describe their data collection approach. The paper collected the date and version number of each Firefox release. Tags within the VCS were used to link issue IDs to releases. The paper discards issues that are potential false positives: IDs that have less five digits, issues that refer to tests instead of bugfixes, any potential ID that is the name of a file. Since the commit logs are linked to the VCS tags, the paper is able to link the issue IDs found within these commit logs to the releases that correspond to those tags.</li>
<li>Method(s) of recruitment of participants: Firefox release history wiki and VCS logs</li>
<li>Sample size: 72114 issue reports from the Firefox system (34673 for traditional releases and 37441 for rapid releases)</li>
<li>Evaluation/measurement description: The paper aims to answer three research questions:
<ul>
<li>Are addressed issues integrated more quickly in rapid releases?
<ul>
<li>Approach: Through beanplots to compare the distributions, the paper first observes the lifetime of the issues of traditional and rapid releases. Next, it looks at the time span of the triaging, fixing, and integration phases within the lifetime of an issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why can traditional releases integrate addressed issues more quickly?
<ul>
<li>Approach: the paper groups traditional and rapid releases into major and minor releases and study their integration delay through beanplots, Mann-Whiteney-Wilcoxon tests, Cliff’s delta, and MAD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Did the change in the release strategy have an impact on the characteristics of delayed issues?
<ul>
<li>Approach: the paper builds linear regression models for both release approaches. The paper firstly estimates the degrees of freedom that can be spent on the models. Secondly, they check for metrics that are highly correlated using Spearman rank correlation tests and perform a redundancy check to remove redundant metrics. The paper then assesses the fit of our models using the ROC area and the Brier score. The ROC area is used to evaluate the degree of discrimination achieved by the model. The Brier score is used to evaluate the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. The used metrics include reporter experience, resolver experience, issue severity, issue priority, project queue rank, number of impacted files and fix time. A full list of metrics can be found in Table 2 of the paper.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Outcomes:
<ul>
<li>Are addressed issues integrated more quickly in rapid releases?
<ul>
<li>Results: There is no significant difference between traditional and rapid releases regarding issue lifetime. Results:</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why can traditional releases integrate addressed issues more quickly?
<ul>
<li>Results: Minor-traditional releases tend to have less integration delay than major/minor-rapid releases.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Did the change in the release strategy have an impact on the characteristics of delayed issues?
<ul>
<li>Results: The models achieve a Brier score of 0.05- 0.16 and ROC areas of 0.81-0.83. Traditional releases prioritize the integration of backlog issues, while rapid releases prioritize the inte- gration of issues of the current release cycle.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Limitations: Defects in the tools that were developed to perform the data collection and evaluation could have an effect on the outcomes. Furthermore, the way that issue IDs are linked to releases may not represent the total addressed issues per release. The results cannot be generalized as the evaluation was solely done on the Firefox system.</li>
<li>Future research: Further research can look into applying the same evaluation strategy to other organizations that switched from traditional to rapid release.</li>

<p>What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>This paper discussed the developments of continuous development over the years until June 2014. This paper has performed a semantic study to identify, classify and analyze primary studies related to continuous development. The paper has found the following major points:
<ul>
<li>Almost all primary studies make reference in one way or another to accelerate the releae cycle by shortening the release cadence and turning it into a continuous flow.</li>
<li>Some reviewed publications claim that accelerating the release cycle can make it harder to perform re-engineering activities.</li>
<li>CD challenges and changes traditional planning towards continuous planning in order to achieve fast and frequent releases.</li>
<li>Tighter integration between planning and execution is required in order to achieve a more holisitic view on planning in CD.</li>
<li>It is important for the engineering and QA teams to ensure backward compatibility of enhancements, so that users perceive only improvements rather than experience any loss of functionality.</li>
<li>Code change activities tend to focus more on bug fixing and maintenance than functional- ity expansion</li>
<li>The architecture must be robust enough to allow the organization to invest its resources in offensive initiatives such as new functionalitity, product enhancements and innovation rather than defensive efforts such as bugfixes.</li>
<li>A major challenge in CD is to retain the balance between speed and quality. Some approaches reviewed by this study propose a focus on measuring and monitoring source code and architectural quality.</li>
<li>To avoid issues such as duplicated testing efforts and slow feedback loops it is important to make all testing activities transparent to individual developers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous and rapid experimentation is an emerging research topic with many possibilities for future work. This is why it’s important to keep up with the newly contributed studies and add them to future reviews to compare their findings.</li>

<ul>
<li>This paper discussed the developments of continuous development over the years. This paper has performed a semantic study to identify, classify and analyze primary studies related to continuous development. The paper finds:
<ul>
<li>Two main motivations for the implementation of frequent software releases in the context of OSS projects, which are the project attractiveness/increase of participants and maintenance and increase of market share</li>
<li>Four main strategies are adopted by practitioners to implement frequent software releases in the context of OSS projects: time-based release, automated release, test-driven development and continuous delivery/deployment.</li>
<li>The main positive points associated to rapid releases are: quick return on customer needs, rapid delivery of new features, quick bug fixes, immediate release security patches, increased efficiency, entry of new collaborators, and greater focus on quality on the part of developers and testers.</li>
<li>The main negative points assocaited to rapid releases are reliability of new versions, increase in the “technical debt”, pressure felt by employees and community dependence.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of the practice? Why?</p>

<p>Reference: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-bacchelli2013expectations">11</a>]</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This paper describes research about the goals and actual effects of code reviews. Interviews and experiments have been done with people in the programming field.</p>
<p>One of the main conclusions is that the main effect of doing code reviews is that everyone involved understands the code better. This is opposed to what the goal of code reviews generally is: discovering errors.</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: in practice; tools</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: empirical; qualitative</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: N/A</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: Data collected from interviews, surveys and code reviews</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What are the motivations and expectations for modern code review? Do they change from managers to developers and testers?</em> The top motivation for code reviews is finding defects, closely followed by code improvement. There does not seem to be a large difference between managers, developers and testers.</li>
<li><em>What are the actual outcomes of modern code review? Do they match the expectations?</em> Code improvements are the most seen outcomes of code review, followed by code understanding and social communication. The outcomes do not match the expectations well. For example, only 14% of researched review comments was about code defects, while about 44% chose finding defects as the main motivation for doing code review.</li>
<li><em>What are the main challenges experienced when performing modern code reviews relative to the expectations and outcomes?</em> The main challenges is by far understanding the code under review. This occurs for example when code has to be reviewed that is not in the same system as a developers works on daily.</li>
</ul>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ2</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tools used</em>: CodeFlow, a reviewing tool. It is not publicly available.</li>
<li><em>Company/organization</em>: Microsoft</li>
<li><em>Evaluation</em>: At the time of this paper, it still focusses mainly on fixing errors, and not on the more often ocurring results of doing code review.</li>
</ul>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ3</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Future research challenges</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research on automating code review tasks. This mainly concerns low-level tasks, like checking boundary conditions or catching common mistakes.</li>
<li>Research on code comprehension during code review. According to the authors research has been done on this with new developers in mind, but it would also be applicable to code reviews. The authors note that IDEs often include tools for code comprehension, but code review tools do not.</li>
<li>Research on awareness and learning during code review. Those two aspects were cited as motivations for code review by developers. Future research could research these aspects more explicitly.</li>

<p><strong>Summary</strong> The broad research questions answered in this article are: How is code review performed in industry today? Which commonalities and variations exist between code review processes of different teams and companies? The article describes a classification scheme for change-based code review processes in industry. This scheme is based on descriptions of the code review processes of eleven companies, obtained from interviews with software engineering professionals that were performed during a Grounded Theory study.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong> This paper, published in 2017, is trying to answer 3 RQs. Firstly, how prevalent is change-based review in the industry? Secondly, does the chance that code review remains in use increase if code review is embedded into the process (and its supporting tools) so that it does not require a conscious decision to do a review? Thirdly, are the intended and acceptable levels of review effects a mediator in determining the code review process?</p>

<p>Reference: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-baysal2013influence">19</a>]</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong> This paper focus on the influence of several non-technical factors on code review response time and outcome. An empirical study of code review process for WebKit, a large open source project was described to see the influence. Specifically, the authors replicated some previously studied factors and extended several more factors that had not beed explored.</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: open-source, impact</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: empirical study</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: WebKit</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: WebKit code review data extracted from Bugzilla.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>What factors can influence how long it takes for a patch to be reviewed?</em> The organizational and personal factors influence review timeliness. Some factors that influenced the time required to review a patch, such as the size of the patch itself or the part of the code base being modified, are unsurprising and are likely related to the technical complexity of a given change. The most influential factors of the code review process on review time are the organization a patch writer is affiliated with and their level of participation within the project.</p></li>
<li><p><em>What factors influence the outcome of the review process?</em> The organizational and personal factors influence the likelihood of a patch being accepted. The most influential factors of the code review process on patch acceptance are the organization a patch writer is affiliated with and their level of participation within the project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ3</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Future research challenges</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research on studying how best to interpret empirical software engineering research within the context of contextual factors. Understanding the reasons behind observable developer behaviour requires an understanding of the contexts, processes, organizational and individual factors that can influence code review and its outcome.</li>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>This article primirarily discusses some non-technical factors that influence the code review process. This are factors like review experience, amount of contributions to a project and company affiliation.</p>
<p>It is found that the most important factors influencing the code review process, in terms of both review time and patch acceptance, are the organization affiliation of the patch writer and the amount of participation of the patch writer in the project.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>What factors can influence how long it takes for a patch to be reviewed?</em> “Based on the results of two empirical studies, we found that both technical (patch size and component) , as well as non-technical (organization, patch writer experience, and reviewer activity) factors affect review timeliness when studying the effect of individual variables. While priority appears to influence review time for WebKit, we were not able to confirm this for Blink.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>What factors influence the outcome of the review process?</em> “Our findings from both studies suggest that patch writer experience affects code review outcome. For the WebKit project, factors like priority, organization, and review queue also have an effect on the patch acceptance.”</p></li>

<li><em>Tools used:</em> CodeFlow, CodeFlow Analytics</li>
<li><em>Company/organization using the tool:</em> Microsoft</li>
<li><em>Evaluation of the tool:</em> CodeFlow has already had a positive implace on development teams because of its simplicity, low barrier for feedback and flexible support of Microsoft’s disparate engineering systems. But some challenges such as dealing with branches and linking reviews to commits need to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for CodeFlow Analytics: the tool is being used increasingly throughout Microsoft, with different teams using the tool for different purposes. It is for example effectively used to create dashboards with code review evaluation information, or for examining past reviews in detail. However, some parts of the tool still need to improve in terms of user-friendliness, for example because some functionality is difficult to find.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong> To investigate how industry carries out software reviews and in what forms, this paper conducted a two-part survey in 2002, the first part based on a national initiative in Germany and the second involving companies worldwide. Additionally, this paper also include some fundamental concepts of code review, such as functionalities of code review.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong> As code review has many uses and benefits, the authors hope to find out whether the current code review methods are sufficiently efficient. They also research whether other methods may be more efficient. With experience gained at Microsoft and with support of data, the authors posit (1) that code reviews often do not find functionality issues that should block a code submission; (2) that effective code reviews should be performed by people with a specific set of skills; and (3) that the social aspect of code reviews cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: impact</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: empirical</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: not mentioned</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: data collected from engineering systems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In what situations, do code reviews provide more value than others?</em> Unlike inspections, code reviews do not require participants to be in the same place nor do they happen at a fixed, prearranged time. Aligning with a distributed nature of many projects, code reviews are asynchronous and frequently supporting geographically distributed reviewers.</li>
<li><em>What is the value of consistency of applying code reviews equally to all code changes?</em> Code review usefulness is negatively correlated with the size of a code review. With 20 or more changed files, the more files there are in a single review, the lower the overall rate of useful feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Future research challenges</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Research on undocumented changes of code review because prior research has neglected.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to its costs, code reviewing practice is a topic deserving to be better understood, systematized and applied to software engineering workflow with more precision than the best practice currently prescribes.</p></li>

<p>Reference: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-gousios2014exploratory">75</a>]</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong> This article focuses on how much pull requests are being used and how they are used, focusing on GitHub. For example, it is concluded that pull-requests are not being used that much, that pull-requests are being merged fast after they have been submitted, and that a pull request not being merged is most of the time not caused by technical errors in the pull-request.</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: open-source, in practice</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: empirical; qualitative for finding out reasons for closing pull request, rest quantitative.</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: Custom developed tools, available online</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: GHTorrent dataset, along with data collected by authors. The last is also available online</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How popular is the pull based development model?</em> “14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github. Pull requests and shared repositories are equally used among projects. Pull request usage is increasing in absolute numbers, even though the proportion of repositories using pull requests has decreased slightly.”</li>
<li><em>What are the lifecycle characteristics of pull requests?</em> “Most pull requests are less than 20 lines long and processed (merged or discarded) in less than 1 day. The discussion spans on average to 3 comments, while code reviews affect the time to merge a pull request. Inclusion of test code does not affect the time or the decision to merge a pull request. Pull requests receive no special treatment, irrespective whether they come from contributors or the core team.”</li>
<li><em>What factors affect the decision and the time required to merge a pull request?</em> “The decision to merge a pull request is mainly influenced by whether the pull request modifies recently modified code. The time to merge is influenced by the developer’s previous track record, the size of the project and its test coverage and the project’s openness to external contributions.”</li>
<li><em>Why are some pull requests not merged?</em> “53% of pull requests are rejected for reasons having to do with the distributed nature of pull based development. Only 13% of the pull requests are rejected due to technical reasons.”</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Tools used</em>: GitHub PR system</li>
<li><em>Company/organization</em>: Several open-source projects</li>
<li><em>Evaluation</em>: N/A</li>
</ul>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ3</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Future research challenges</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>More research is needed on <em>drive-by commits</em>, which the paper loosely defines as commits added to a repository through a PR by a user that has never contributed to the repository and hence does so for the first time. Often this new contributor also has created a fork for the sole purpose of creating this PR. More research is needed on accurately defining drive-by commits and on assessing their implications.</li>
<li>More research is needed on the effect of the democratization of the develoment process, which occurs for example through the use of pull requests. Democratization could for example lead to a substantially stronger commons ecosystem.</li>
<li>Validating the used models on data from different sources and on projects on different languages.</li>
<li>Research on the motives of developers to work in a highly transparent workspace.</li>
<li>Research on formation of teams and management hierarchies with respect to open-source projects.</li>
<li>Research on novel code review practices.</li>
<li>Research on ways to managing tasks in the pull-based development model.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges in practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of tools to help the core team of a project with prioritizing their work. The paper gives as an example a tool which would suggest whether a pull request can be merged or not, because this can be predicted with fairly high accuracy.</li>
<li>Development of tools that would suggest categories of improvement for pull request, for example by suggesting that more documentation needs to be added.</li>

<p><strong>Summary</strong> This paper focuses on the influence of doing light-weight code reviews on software quality. In particular, the effect of review coverage (the part of the code that has been reviewed) and review participation (a measure for how much reviewers are involved in the review process) are being assessed.</p>
<p>It turns out that both aspects improve software quality when they are higher. Review participation is the most influential. According to the authors there are other aspects, which they have not looked into, that are of significant importance for the review process.</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>

<li><em>Research method</em>: qualitative for finding out the impact of code review coverage and code review participation on software quality rest quantitative.</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: N/A</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: Data extracted from Qt, VTK and ITK code review dataset and necessary metrics including version control metrics, coverage metrics and participation metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Is there a relationship between code review coverage and post-release defects?</em> Although review coverage is negatively associated with software quality in our models, several defect-prone components have high coverage rates, suggesting that other properties of the code review process are at play.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Is there a relationship between code review participation and post-release defects?</em> Lack of participation in code review has a negative impact on software quality. Reviews without discussion are associated with higher post-release defect counts, suggesting that the amount of discussion generated during review should be considered when making integration decisions.</p></li>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>This paper presents (1) research on how often a reviewer cannot be found for a code change and the influence of this on the time it takes to process a code change, (2) a tool (<em>RevFinder</em>) for automatically suggesting reviewers based on files reviewed previously, and (3) an empirical evaluation of that tool on four open-source projects.</p>
<p>Of the researched projects, up to 30% of the code changes have problems finding a reviewer. These reviews take on average 12 days longer. Also, it is found that RevFinder works 3 to 4 times better than an existing tool.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How do reviews with code-reviewer assignment problem impact reviewing time?</em> “4%-30% of reviews have code-reviewer assignment problem.

<li><em>Does RevFinder accurately recommend code-reviewers?</em> “RevFinder correctly recommended 79% of reviews with a top-10 recommendation. RevFinder is 4 times more accurate than ReviewBot. This indicates that leveraging a similarity of previously reviewed file path can accurately recommend code-reviewers.”</li>
<li><em>Does RevFinder provide better ranking of recommended code-reviewers?</em> “RevFinder recommended the correct code-reviewers with a median rank of 4. The code-reviewers ranking of RevFinder is 3 times better than that of ReviewBot, indicating that RevFinder provides a better ranking of correct code-reviewers.”</li>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">11.3.1.16</span> Revisiting code ownership and its relationship with software quality in the scope of modern code review</h4>
<p>Reference: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-thongtanunam2016revisiting">182</a>]</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>This paper researches the effect code reviews have on code ownership. This question is answered by looking at two open-source projects. It was found that a lot of contributors do not submit code changes for a specific ticket, but still do quite some reviewing. It was also found that code that contains post-release errors has often been reviewed or authored by people who neither author or review often.</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: code ownership</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: empirical; quantitative</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: R; Custom</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: Review dataset from Hamasaki et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-hamasaki2013does">79</a>]</span>. Code dataset from the Qt system from McIntosh et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-mcintosh2014impact">131</a>]</span>. Ammended with custom datasets for Qt and OpenStack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>How do code authoring and reviewing contributions differ?</em> “The developers who only contribute to a module by reviewing code changes account for the largest set of contributors to that module. Moreover, 18%-50% of these review-only developers are documented core developers of the studied systems, suggesting that code ownership heuristics that only consider authorship activity are missing the activity of these major contributors.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>Should code review activity be used to refine traditional code ownership heuristics?</em> “Many minor authors are major reviewers who actually make large contributions to the evolution of modules by reviewing code changes. Code review activity can be used to refine traditional code ownership heuristics to more accurately identify the defect-prone modules.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>Is there a relationship between review-specific and review-aware code ownership heuristics and defect-proneness?</em> “Even when we control for several confounding factors, the proportion of developers in the minor author &amp; minor reviewer category shares a strong relationship with defectproneness. Indeed, modules with a larger proportion of developers without authorship or reviewing expertise are more likely to be defect-prone.”</p></li>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">11.3.1.17</span> Review participation in modern code review</h4>
<p>Reference: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-thongtanunam2017review">181</a>]</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong> This paper discusses the factors that influence review participation in code review. Previous studies identified that review participation influences the code review process significantly, but did not study the factors that actually influence review participation.</p>
<p>It was most importantly found that “(…) the review participation history, the description length, the number of days since the last modification of files, the past involvement of an author, and the past involvement of reviewers share a strong relationship with the likelihood that a patch will suffer from poor review participation.”</p>

<li><em>Research method</em>: empirical; quantitative</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: N/A</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: Review data for the Android, Qt and OpenStack projects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>What patch characteristics share a relationship with the likelihood of a patch not being selected by reviewers?</em> “We find that the number of reviewers of prior patches, the number of days since the last modification of the patched files share a strong increasing relationship with the likelihood that a patch will have at least one reviewer. The description length is also a strong indicator of a patch that is likely to not be selected by reviewers.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>What patch characteristics share a relationship with the likelihood of a patch not being discussed?</em> “We find that the description length, churn, and the discussion length of prior patches share an increasing relationship with the likelihood that a patch will be discussed. We also find that the past involvement of reviewers shares an increasing relationship with the likelihood. On the other hand, the past involvement of an author shares an inverse relationship with the likelihood.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>What patch characteristics share a relationship with the likelihood of a patch receiving slow initial feedback?</em> “We find that the feedback delay of prior patches shares a strong relationship with the likelihood that a patch will receive slow initial feedback. Furthermore, a patch is likely to receive slow initial feedback if its purpose is to introduces new features.”</p></li>

<p>Reference: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-zanjani2016automatically">198</a>]</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>This paper introduces <em>cHRev</em>, a reviewer recommendation approach that, according to the paper, works better in most circumstances than <em>RevFinder</em> introduces by Thongtanunam et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-thongtanunam2015should">183</a>]</span>. It recommends reviewers based on their previous review activity. For this it notably uses the frequency of reviews for a specific part of the system and also how recent the reviewing activity was.</p>

<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: reviewer recomendation</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: quantitative; empirical</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: Custom</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>What is the accuracy of cHRev in recommending reviewers on real software systems across closed and open source projects?</em> “cHRev makes accurate reviewer recommendations in terms of precision and recall. On average, less than two recommendations are needed to find the first correct reviewer in both closed and open source systems.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>How do the accuracies of cHRev (trained from the code review history), REVFINDER (also, trained from the code review history, albeit differently), xFinder (trained from the commit history), and RevCom (trained from a combination of the code review and commit histories) compare in recommending code reviewers?</em> “cHRev performs much better than REVFINDER which is based on reviewers of files with similar names and paths and xFinder which relies on source code repository data, and cHRev is statistically equivalent to RevCom which requires both past reviews and commits.”</p></li>
